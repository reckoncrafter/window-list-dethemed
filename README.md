# window-list Dethemed

This repository exists so I don't have to do this by hand again.

The default window-list extension in [gnome-shell-extensions](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell-extensions) looks like garbage (it does -- I will not be accepting any criticism on this front), so I edited the stylesheet to get rid of the box shadows.
